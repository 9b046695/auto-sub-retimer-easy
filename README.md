# How to Install

0. Make sure you have Python installed. If you are unsure you can check by opening Command Prompt or Powershell and entering the command "python --version".

1. Download the zip from github

2. Extract to somewhere, ideally somewhere you know you won't accidentally erase it (not your Downloads directory)

3. There are 4 files ending with ".reg". 3 of them adds items to your right click options. You can choose to add either one individually or both under single item to save space. The 4th item "removeAll" removes all the right click options added.

3. All 3 registry files ending in "Subs" are run the same way. Open the files in a word processor such as Notepad or SublimeText, and change all lines containing "C:\\Users\\CK\\Documents\\auto-sub-retimer\\" to the actual location of the auto-sub-retimer directory in your computer. The example has it in the Documents folder of a user named CK, so if you also put it in your Documents folder you can simply change "CK" to your own Windows username.

4. You can now right click on your show directory (which should contain the video and subtitle files for the auto-sub-retimer to work properly) and select RetimeSubs or RenameSubs to run the auto-sub-retimer program.
